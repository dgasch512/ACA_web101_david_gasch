					<h2>Consistency is key</h2>
					<h6>Find a happy medium</h6>
					<p class="quote">
							<span>I</span> ran into a roadblock making a responsive webpage. I wanted to add pictures across a header section, and I wanted my h5 placed over the image. My first thought was to add the img and h5 within a div, and attempt to place them within the same area on the page. No matter how wrote or re-wrote my code I couldn’t seem to make it respond how I wanted it to. Everything else worked exactly how I intended but the dang h5 had a mind of its own.... <a href="https://medium.com/@gaschdav208/consistency-is-key-356bd53bf9d0">Read more!</a>

					<h2>Working Together</h2>
					<h6>Grid and Flex — Teamwork makes the dream work</h6>
					<p class="quote">
							<span>U</span>sing Flexbox and CSS Grid together seems to eliminate the limitations of each one individually. By creating a grid and then using flex box to move the elements within each grid area I can more easily set the webpage to look and act how I need it to. CSS Grids looked like it would solve all my initial layout issues and I did not expect to use flex anymore. However, Juan showed how using them together provides the most efficient use of either of them. Layout and placement in CSS has never been easier... <a href="https://medium.com/@gaschdav208/working-together-76d165e29505">Read more!</a>

				<h2>A Day In The Life</h2>
				
				<h6>Getting The Point Across Efficiently</h6>
		
				<p class="quote">
					<span>I</span>’ve come to notice certain little nuances with coding that affect how the page works. During class we reviewed divs and the way they work to structure a page. I’ve understood their function and how they group elements or sections together, but in class we reviewed how they can be structured to work together. The ability to place several divs inside a main div to focus control over elements opened a lot of doors in my mind. Further, while coding the media queries landing page I found that an image can be placed inside of a div, by itself, to increase ways to control how the image reacts to other elements on the page. <a href="https://medium.com/@gaschdav208/a-day-in-the-life-f38963528bba">Read more!</a>

		<h2>GIT On Up</h2>
		
		<h6>GIT as integral to daily life as that cup of joe - forever</h6>

		<p class="quote">
			<span>G</span>IT is the most prolific version control software, and a vital tool for coders. Not only does the software allow for saved versions of code over time, it allows for multiple branches of a project at any time. This means all changes to a project are available for review and debugging, while multiple users can edit code separately and merge the work together without inhibiting the process for others. <a href="https://medium.com/@gaschdav208/git-on-up-f93102d8feef">Read more!</a>

			<h2>Ambition Reinvigorated in Opportunity</h2>

				<h6>Coding reestablished a passion and career trajectory I thought was lost</h6>

				<p class="quote">
						<span>I</span>’ve always found a passion in creating. This has taken many forms over the years, most prominently in journalism, graphic design, film or writing. My happy place consists of those moments when I’m so focused and involved on tweaking aspects of my project and trying to fit the pieces together. Though I have a place in my heart for all of these forms of creation, I never quite found a home in them. With coding it is different.  <a href="https://medium.com/@gaschdav208/ambition-reinvigorated-in-opportunity-7fd43f90c1c5">Read more!</a>
